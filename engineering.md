# Engineering

The engineering document describes the choices made for the different parts of the rover.

## Translating the requirements

In order to determine the shape, size and exact characteristics of the rover we first need to
translate the requirements into more concrete information.

### Must-Have Requirement: Cooperating with human operators

The high level requirement is:

    The CrateRover is designed to cooperate with human operators. As such it will behave in ways
    that prevent any damage to humans, animals, property and the cargo.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover needs to have sensors that can detect stationary and moving obstacles
* The rover should be able to predict with some accuracy the path that will be taken by moving
  obstacles and use this information for obstacle avoidance and trajectory planning
* The rover should be able to adapt the trajectory due to changes in directions of obstacles
* The rover will provide safe methods of stopping the rover, either remotely or up close
* The rover will need to be able to deal with failures in a safe manner

### Must-Have Requirement: Task planning

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be able to receive and action requests to take given cargo from one location
    to another. The request may come via a number of channels, some of those using natural language.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover needs to be able to receive and process high level tasks, e.g. collect item X from
  location A and take it to location B, where location definitions may be fuzzy, e.g. a description
  rather than an exact coordinate.
* The rover needs to be able to communicate the plan for achieving the provided goal and provide
  progress updates while it executes the task.
* The rover should be able to understand a, potentially limited, form of natural language.

### Must-Have Requirement: Navigation

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be able transport cargo from a given start location to a given destination
    location using a self determined trajectory that takes into account the safety of any humans,
    animals and the cargo.

This requirement comes with a number of limitations. Specifically:

1) **Limitation:** The rover will be able to pick up cargo from locations with a minimum usable
  area equivalent to 100% of the size of the rover and the cargo combined.
1) **Limitation:** The rover will be able to navigate tight turns
1) **Limitation:** Assume that the maximum velocity on sloped ground will be no more than
  **2.0 m/s**. The velocity on flat ground may be higher.
1) **Limitation:** Assume that the maximum slope angle for transports with the maximum weight
  will be no more than **15 degrees**.
1) **Limitation:** The rover will be consider having reached its destination if it is no more than
  0.05 meters away from it.

Translating this requirement with the limitations leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover will be able to plan a trajectory, i.e. a path with a velocity and acceleration components,
  from the start position to the goal position.
* The trajectory planning will take into account the stability of the cargo and rover at any point
  on the trajectory.
* Static and dynamic detection of in-appropriate paths, e.g. detecting inappropriate slopes while
  moving and being able to update the planned trajectory with the information.
* The rover will be able to monitor the status of the cargo, specifically for the stability perspective.
* The rover will possess all-wheel steering, with 360 degree rotation. This allows both tight turns
  as well as in place rotations and crab moves, which may all be necessary for accurate placement.
* Trajectory planning needs to take into account the provided limitations on performance as well as
  structural limits and limits on the drive and steering system.
* Construction of the drive and steering system should be such that the location of the rover can
  be achieved to the required accuracy.

### Must-Have Requirement: Carrying cargo

The high level requirement is:

    The rover must be able to carry cargo with a maximum weight of **50.0 kg** with a minimum
    bounding box of **0.60m x 0.40m x 0.30m (L x W x H)**. This weight and size allows the rover to
    carry a reasonable size crate with contents.

This requirement comes with a number of limitations. Specifically:

1) **Limitation:** The rover will not be able to load or unload the cargo. It is assumed that a
  human operator will handle the safe and secure loading, securing and unloading of the cargo.

Translating this requirement with the limitations leads to the following engineering demands:

* The maximum cargo weight is 50 kg
* The rover should at least be able to carry a box of size 0.60m x 0.40m x 0.30m
* The rover will provide a means of securing the cargo

### Must-Have Requirement: Environments

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be able to perform its tasks in both an indoor and an outdoor environment. Use
    in harsh environments should not impede the rover from performing its tasks, nor should it
    lead to damage.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover will be able to traverse different surface types. The minimum expectation is
  * Concrete
  * Asphalt
  * Hard packed dirt
  * Sand
  * Light mud
* The rover is shielded as much as possible from ingress of foreign materials into the sensitive
  components of the rover.
* The rover will provide easy ways for foreign materials to be removed from the rover, either
  automatically or with the assistance of an operator.
* It should be possible to clean the rover without damaging it or the operator doing the cleaning.

### Must-Have Requirement: Communication

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be able to communicate status and progress.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover needs one or more ways in which it can communicate its status, both for local
  and remote operators.
* The rover needs one or more ways in which it can communicate the progress of the current task.

### Must-Have Requirement: Construction

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be easy to construct and maintain

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover should be made from standard materials and parts as much as possible
* The rover should be able to be assembled with simple tools
* The assembly order should be obvious
* It should be possible to easily remove parts for replacement or repair
* It should be easy to maintain those parts that need maintenance

### Nice-To-Have Requirement: Oversize loads

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be able to carry an oversize load safely to the destination.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover should be able to determine the shape and size of the cargo.
* The rover should be able to determine the position of the cargo relative to its own chassis.
* Trajectory planning should take into account the larger foot print of the rover with cargo, including
  turning radius and slope start and end.
* The rover will provide means of securing oversized cargo.

### Nice-To-Have Requirement: Request assistance

The high level requirement is:

    The rover will be able to request assistance from a human operator if required. The request for
    help will be done in natural language and specific. Such that the human operator can quickly
    determine what needs to be done.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover will provide means of communication, via text or voice
* The rover will be able to determine the cause of any issues to such a degree that it can provide
  a clear description of the issue to a human operator
* The rover will be able to provide specific instructions to resolve the issue to a human operator.
  This includes providing the operator with the appropriate context

### Nice-To-Have Requirement: Multi-rover tasks

The high level requirement is:

   The rover will be able to cooperate with other rovers to carry large and oversize loads to the
   destination location. The rovers will collaborate to move the cargo safely and keeping in mind
   the stability limits for the cargo. Any issues with cargo stability and safety will be reported
   to human operators before and during the journey.

Translating this requirement leads to the following engineering demands:

* The rover will be able to communicate with other rovers.
* The rover will be able to determine which other rovers are able to form a team.
* The rovers will be able to create a plan. This plan will include the tasks for each rover.
* While performing the task the rovers will coordinate amongst themselves.

## Component requirements

Using the engineering demands we can come up with the detailed requirements for the components that
make up the rover. For the purposes of this document we split discussion into three parts, the overall
dimensions and performance, the requirements for the hardware and finally the requirements for the
software.

    * Steering and drive --> Probably a single controller because steering and drive are strongly
      connected in swerve
    * Sensors
    * Recovery
    * Fault handling

### Dimensions and performance

The general dimensions and performance requirements for the rover are as follows:

* Dimensions: The minimal dimensions for the cargo are **0.60m * 0.40m * 0.30m (length * width * height)**.
  The minimum dimensions for the rover will be slightly larger than the minimum cargo dimensions.
  Stability, structural and performance requirements may increase one or more dimensions of the rover.
  Thus the rover will have the following minimum dimensions.
  * Length: minimal 0.65m
  * Width: minimal 0.45m
  * Height: Depends on wheel size + structure
* The maximum rover speed is set to be fast enough to move cargo at a reasonable rate while providing
  the rover with enough time to react when obstacles appear. Based on this the rover should be able
  to move at **2.0 m/s** in a straight line while carrying cargo over terrain with maximum
  slope of **15 degrees**. Further limitations are set to other speeds and accelerations. The
  deceleration requirements are set such that the rover can come to a full stop from its maximum
  velocity in less than 1 meter of distance.
  * Maximum linear velocity without cargo: **2.0 m/s**
  * Maximum linear velocity with cargo: **2.0 m/s**
  * Maximum linear acceleration: **1.0 m/s^2**
  * Minimum linear deceleration: **4.0 m/s^2**
  * Minimum linear velocity: **0.10 m/s**
* The obstacle avoidance update rate (Hz): **TBD**
* Response times
  * Object detection: **TBD**
  * Obstacle response: **TBD**

### Safety

As the rover moves around in a dynamic environment it is paramount that it is able to do so in a safe
manner. There are many different areas that need to be considered in order to design and build a rover
that can navigate the world in a safe manner. For the time being these areas and their considerations
are as follows.

* **Task planning:** Ensure that tasks can be executed safely. This involves determining if the specific
  cargo can safely be carried, if there is a safe path to transport the cargo from origin to destination,
  what the minimum and maximum acceleration and deceleration limits are etc.. This information can then
  be used in other safety related areas to determine their limits. For instance the combined dimensions
  of rover and cargo may be used by the trajectory planning algorithms to determine a safe path. One other
  important responsibility for the task planning system is to handle the failure to achieve a running
  task.
* **Trajectory planning:** To plan a safe trajectory from the origin to the destination, taking into
  account the conditions of the surroundings and the state of the cargo, e.g. the maximum slope angle,
  minimum passage size, safe turning radii, safe velocities in areas with traffic etc..
* **Obstacle detection:** Ensure that all obstacles can be detected in varying environmental conditions.
* **Obstacle avoidance:** To plan a safe path around obstacles, whether they are known or unknown, and
  static or dynamic. The obstacle avoidance process should consider the safe limits for different
  maneuvers and select the safest of the available options. Additionally the obstacle avoidance system
  should also be able to handle the case where diverting around an obstacle is no longer possible. In
  this case the system should determine safe ways and locations to halt the rover.
* **Rover status:** Being able to detect and alleviate any issues with the rover and its cargo. This
  includes being able to detect and try to resolve issues with the electrical and data systems, the
  ability to respond to mechanical issues, sensor failures and the stability of the cargo.
* **Impact absorption:** While all the other areas aim to avoid failure it is inevitable that
  eventually the rover will experience a failure, which may lead to a collision with an obstacle.
  Therefore the design should consider impact absorption with the goal to minimize damage to all
  parties involved.
* **User interrupts:** The user should be able to stop the rover at any point both remotely and by
  physically pressing an emergency stop button.

### Hardware

#### General - chassis

The rover base consists of the several parts. The first part is the chassis, which provides the
structure that will carry the cargo as well as providing attachment locations for the cargo
manipulation system, the drive system, and the electric and electronic systems.
The second part is the drive system which contains the steering and drive motors and provides
the ability to move the rover in any direction. The third part is the electronic and electrical
system which includes sensors, batteries and the compute hardware that provides command and control
over the rover.

As the chassis forms the base of the rover structure it is important that it is designed such that
the rover is able to perform to the standards provided earlier. The chassis will be made from
**aluminium extrusions**. This ensures that the chassis is both strong and light enough while it is
also being easy to assemble and repair.

The combination of the chassis and the drive system determines performance and stability of the
rover.

* The rover should be stable while carrying cargo on both flat ground and slopes up to **15 degrees**.
  This requirement applies in both when the rover is parked, as well as when the rover is in motion.
* When loading or unloading cargo the rover should be stable. Cargo should be able to be picked
  up from the ground and loaded onto the rover, as well as unloaded from the rover and placed on the
  ground. On flat ground the rover should be able to pick up cargo from either the left or the right
  hand side. On sloped ground the rover should only pick up cargo from the high side, i.e. where
  the ground is higher than the lowest rover wheel. At no point should the rover be in danger of
  tipping over.
* The drive system will consist of **4 wheels**, all of which will be **driven** and provide
  **unlimited steering rotation**. This ensures maximum traction on uneven terrain, provides the
  ability for the rover  to navigate in situations that require high maneuverability, to position
  itself with high accuracy, and do all of this while also carrying a heavy load. Each of the 4
  wheels will be attached to their own **drive module**, all of which will be identical for ease
  of design, assembly and repair. Drive modules should be easy to swap out with minimal tools.

#### General - Electronics, electrical power and data

The layout and design of the electrical system for a mobile robot is an extensive area that consist
of many sub-parts. This section will discuss the general design rules for the electrical power system,
data transfer lines and the layout of the electronics parts.

One of the main requirements for the design of the electrical system is to ensure that the system
is safe to use and safe to build and maintain. This means that

* The user should both be able to quickly determine if the system is powered and remove the
  power from the system or sub-systems.
  * The user should be able to disconnect the power to the entire rover with a single safe action.
  * The user should be able to quickly see if any part of the system has been energized.
  * The user should be able to remove power from subsections of the system with a single action.
  * The user should able to to remove power from the motors and their controllers without removing
    power from the compute nodes.
* The user should be able to determine the state of the battery with respect to environmental and
  charge states, both on the rover as well as remotely.
* The user should be able to determine the voltage and current for each subsystem, both on the rover
  and remotely.
* The circuit design should take into account unsafe behaviour of the components present in the circuit,
  for instance:
  * Electrical motor and relay back EMF should be handled so that it will not endanger other components
  * Input and output pins on compute nodes should be protected against inadvertent use, i.e. input
    pins should be protected against being used as output pins and visa-versa. Additionally both types
    of pins should never be exposed to voltages and currents higher than those stated in the
    specifications for the compute node.

The next part of the design for the electrical system is to make it easy to build, maintain and
extend.

* The electrical and data system will be constructed from different modules, e.g. drive module(s),
  sensors, compute module(s), actuators etc..
* The rover will send power from the battery pack to a power distribution panel from which the
  different modules can obtain their power. This provides for a central location where power can be
  turned off, as well as providing a location where individual modules can be depowered.
* Data wires will be grouped together and routed through dedicated low voltage channels, separated
  from the 'high voltage' power delivery wires.

With these base requirements defined the next part of the requirements for the electrical system
can be specified. These are the delivery of electrical power and data signals. Starting with the
requirements for the delivery of electrical power:

* The rover will be powered by a battery pack that delivers 24V of electrical power. The maximum
  current and total capacity of the battery are determined by the performance requirements for the
  rover.
* Charging the battery pack can be done either by taking the battery module out of the rover but also
  by connecting to the charge port.
* The power distribution panel will deliver either 24V or 12V to the modules, depending on what
  the module needs.
* Each electrical module will be configured to receive either 24V or 12V.
* Each module will take care of its own power conditioning to the standards required by the module.
* Sensors are powered from the module that processes their signals
* Motors are powered from their specific motor power distribution board

The requirement for the data transfer part of the electrical system are:

* The wiring and protocol for data is either
  [EtherCAT or CAN](https://www.botblox.io/blogs/learn/what-s-the-best-communication-bus-for-robots-and-drones).
  CAN is the most widely supported and has great resilience against disturbances

Finally when working with mobile robots it is important to provide suitable indication of the state of the
robot to the users. It is suggested that the following indicators are used:

* The status of different components will be indicated by different colored LEDs. The use of LEDs
  provides an indication of the component status while at the same time minimizing the energy
  usage and complexity. The LED colors have the following meanings:
  * White - head light
  * Red - power status; rear light; brake light
  * Orange - motor activation state; direction indicators; movement alert (blinking)
  * Yellow - Sensor activated
  * Green - Data transfer
  * Blue - N/A
* The rover will have warning lights indicating that the rover, or part thereof, is moving. Orange
  flashing LEDs will be used around the rover base when the rover is moving. Individual moving parts
  will have their own set of orange flashing LEDs when these parts are moving.

#### Drive module

As indicated the rover will have 4 drive modules, each of which provides one wheel with driving
torque and infinite steering rotation.

* The diameter of the wheel will be : **0.20 m** based on the idea that we want the rover to be able
  to traverse obstacles of about 0.05m height, which should be enough to traverse along slightly
  rough outdoor tracks.
* Width: minimum **0.05 m** based on the idea that we want enough surface area to distribute the
    total weight of rover and cargo over a big enough area to reduce ground pressure.
* The drive motors will be attached to the rover chassis and driving torque will be transferred by
  mechanical means so as to reduce the inertia of the wheel and to allow for infinite steering rotation
  of the wheel. As a side benefit this allows placing the motor in a location where it is easier to
  protect it from dirt.
* Braking power is supplied by the motors and potentially a brake on the drive shaft. Having brakes
  attached to the wheel would complicate the wheel assembly, and specifically the steering assembly
  as the goal is to have a wheel with infinite steering rotation.
* Each wheel assembly will have independent suspension with a total travel distance of no more than
  the diameter of the wheel
* The wheels will be driven by DC electric motors which should provide sufficient torque and
  rotational velocity to achieve the required carrying capacity for the given terrain.
* Sensors will be place in a suitable to location to track both the rotational velocity and
  current position of the wheel, either directly or indirectly, so that wheel odometry can be
  provided.
  * If possible sensors and methods used to detect wheel slip should be added
* Optionally sensors can be applied to the wheel assembly to measure the vertical and horizonal
  position, velocity and acceleration of the different parts of the module, e.g. the suspension
  arms etc.
* Maximum speed at which the wheel can be steered (i.e. change direction) of the wheel
  unit: **100 - 120 rotations per minute**.
* The minimum steering accuracy, i.e. the accuracy of the steering angle, should be no
  less than **1 degree**.
* The steering system should not be back drivable so as to ensure that a set steering angle
  will not change due to external factors
* Methods should be provided for determining the steering angle on start-up without the need
  to perform zero-ing movements.
* A dedicated compute board will be used to orchestrating the different drive modules so that the
  drive modules can be be synchronised. This module will need provide real time control and fault
  detection
  * Each module has at least 1 motor controller (for 2 motors) and some kind of controller board
    that tells the motor controller(s) what to do
  * Need to feedback current rotation rates and positions back from the module to the overall
    system
  * Would be good to feedback suspension state as well.
* Fault handling for if one of the steering or drive motors doesn't respond


#### Loading arm

* Arm to grab stuff from the ground and put it in the bucket(s)
* 4 degrees of freedom
  * rotate the entire arm
  * rotate shoulder
  * rotate elbow
  * gripper
  * Assume gripper is gravity directed
* Try to keep the arm light
* joint rotation backlash --> ???


#### Sensors

* System redundancy
* Monitoring
* Bumpers on all sides to reduce damage in case of hitting anything.
  * Bumpers should wrap around so that they can't get caught on things
  * Maybe add a pull sensor on the bumper in case a bumper gets caught
* Cliff sensors to detect drop offs
* Sensors for detecting obstacles. When approaching an obstacle, either turn away from it or
  slow down and come to a stop near the obstacle
* Laser ground sensor (like a laser mouse) for ground tracking and speed / rotation
* IMU
* Combine multiple sensors for travel speeds and rotations
* For IR detectors we may have to change the sensitivity, e.g. when we are in a corner we'll see
  a lot of detections, this will overload our processing. In the open field we can
* When reading rotation speeds for the wheels you need to read off the wheels if you have a diff,
  because otherwise you don't know how much the wheels have moved
  * When reading off the wheel note that for slow movement this is probably inaccurate unless we
    have lots of sensor 'points' for a single rotation (but then we might not know where we came from?)
* Temperature sensors for the motors
* General temperature / pressure sensor for environmental conditions
* Each (?) sensor will be paired with a yellow LED, which will light up when the sensor detects
  something
* Force sensors in carrying deck to determine weight of cargo and placement of cargo

  * Decision tree
  * ROS(?) nodes
    * Can use multiplexers for twist commands and probably also for path / trajectory
    * Node for generating movement, e.g. move backwards by x amount
    * Ideally have one node type that translates from trajectory to velocity??
    * Pay attention to the number of running algorithms --> too many things running is bad for performance

* Security
* Performance
  * Try not to load the compute boards for more than X % so that there is always room for interupts
    * Maybe no more than 50%?

#### Algorithms

* Slew rate generator - how fast / slow can you change the motor speed -> Because gearboxes don't like quick changes
* Movement and predictability - People are pretty good with predicting smooth movements, but
  bad with jerky movements --> position, velocity, acceleration, jerk (change in acceleration), snap (change in jerk, acceleration of the acceleration)

* Task planning
  * Cargo dimensions and weight
    * Can it safely be carried
    * Are the dimensions safe for travel
    * What are the limits for slope angle, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, turning radius, swing radius when
      turning around the c.o.g.
  * Origin / destination
    * Can it safely be loaded, e.g. are we on a steep slope
    * Is there a safe path from the origin to the destination
    * Will be iterative with trajectory planning
  * State of charge - Can we reach the destination and have enough battery charge to get to a
    charge station
* Trajectory planning
  * smooth path generation using splines
  * Ideally have limit outsides for obstacles
  * Make sure that the outside motors are the limit on speeds
  * At waypoints we don't need to stop just keep direction, speed and acceleration
    the same on both sides of the way point
  * For turns we need to calculate the maximum speeds, both for wheel maximum speed
    and also for wheel direction reversals and cargo / rover minimum radius / tip over etc.
  * Trajectory planning - Path planning with a time component that describes the different velocities
  * Keep in mind state-of-charge. Potentially don't accept missions that are too long
  * Have multiple path planning algorithms. Some that use a complete map and some that allow unknown
    terrain. Switch between the algorithms.
    * Might be worth having some kind of selection method for selecting the best path / trajectory
      planning system
  * Find some way of getting a rough global map and then use reactive planning to go places
    The global map will allow users to request a location, while the reactive planning allows the
    robot to avoid obstacles
  * Determine what we want from a planning algorithm
    * Work with the limitations of the rover (kinematics etc.), including differential drive and 4W steering
    * Robust - Should be able to deal with unexpected obstacles etc.
    * Reliable - It should consistently get the robot to the goal
    * Smooth - G1 continuous is good, G2 continuous is better. Want smooth movement at all times
    * Adaptable - It should be able to adapt to changing conditions / environment and able to replan if required
    * Multi-goal - Able to deal with multiple goals / waypoints in a single planning session. Need
      to have smooth transitions between the goals and prescribed positions / orientations at way points
    * Able to handle actual robot geometry (not all robots are round)
    * Efficient - It should be able to find the shortest path
* Navigation
  * Need some form of path planning. In general there is a global planner and a local one. The global
    planner determines a route in advance and the local planner tries to follow that route while dealing
    with obstacles, either static or dynamic
  * Swerve has the advantage that we can turn the robot body in any direction while continuing along
    the same path, i.e. the orientation of the robot body is decoupled from the direction of motion
  * For our path planners this means that we can turn the robot body to move past obstacles.
    * This could be especially important for cases where the rover is carrying an oversized load
  * Additionally when dealing with hills the decoupling could mean that we can keep the robot in the most
    stable position (e.g. front facing up hill) while still moving along the slope
  * High level commands for motors are normally a velocity and an angle / direction which are then translated into
    rotational velocity and direction for the motors. However for a swerve drive we have more degrees of freedom so
    the high level commands can specify a velocity vector (where is the rover going) and a 'pointing' vector (where
    is the rover pointing). At a lower level this can be translated into a rotation and a velocity, combined with the
    final pointing direction.
    * From there we need to work out the rotational direction of each wheel, based on where we want to go and the
      speed at which we want to change direction (steer in the same direction vs front and back steering in the
      opposite direction)
  * Need trajectory planning - Create a path to the goal, but also deal with the need to smoothly change the wheel
    speed and direction. Additionally for a swerve drive we also need to figure out what direction we need to face in
    * Temporal planning of movement direction, rotations, and the direction the robot is facing
* SLAM / VSLAM
* Object detection
* What are the performance requirements for the algorithms

#### Controllers

* System redundancy
* Monitoring
* Fault handling
* safety
  * <https://robops.org/manifesto>
  * Errors in sensors --> No signal isn't good (but in some cases it means no detections??)
  * Robot responses to mechanical failure
  * Cargo stability
  * Errors in detection
  * Sensor disagreements
  * Loss of connection -> Should be handled without issue. If there is a task running then we continue with that task, safely


* Sensors
  * Leaky integrators everywhere --> slowly acquire fault states --> Useful to determine if the robot is stuck
* Modules
  * SLAM -> simultaneous localization and mapping
  * Path planning / Trajectory planning
  * Navigation
  * Odometry



## Components



### Hardware

* How to deal with tolerances
  * Tolerance for fit etc.
  * Tolerance for the final parts, e.g. how much can the frame be out of square without influence on
    the robots behaviour

#### Bumper

* Progressive spring
* Include contact sensor to notify when something contacts


* Be visible through colour, lights and sounds
  * Ideally the sound won't be a continuous beeping noise because that's annoying

### Software

### Task planning

* Goal isn't reachable --> Inform the humans
* Failure of some sub-system --> Either stop, or return to base?
* Battery running low --> Back to charge station + inform human

#### Obstacle avoidance

* If the rover is going to crash, attempt to move in a way that minimizes damage to people, animals and the cargo

* FMEA -> Failure Mode Effects Criticality Analysis -> Try to predict failures before they happen
